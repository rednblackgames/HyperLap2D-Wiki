Shaders undoubtedly raise the quality of a game to another level. HyperLap2D can handle different types of Shaders to suit all situations.

- Shaders for `individual entities` are applied only to the texture associated with the entity during the rendering phase.
- `Global Shaders` are applied to the entire screen.
- `Screen Reading Shaders` allow the entity to read as a texture the screen content to create advanced effects.
