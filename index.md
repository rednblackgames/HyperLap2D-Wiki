**[HyperLap2D](https://hyperlap2d.rednblack.games/)** is a general-purpose visual editor that helps you describe complex scenes with an easy to use drag and drop UI along with many useful tools. It doesnâ€™t contain any business logic, just a pure description of all graphical assets.

Your graphic creations can easily come to life thanks to the Runtime libraries, which allow you to concentrate on the development of your video game without having to worry about managing an efficient rendering.

> Currently the development is mainly focused on the [libGDX](https://libgdx.com) framework, but HyperLap2D can be easily integrated into any other framework/engine.

### Getting Started

Those can be downloaded from [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/rednblackgames/HyperLap2D/actions) page (A GitHub account is required). Those builds are useful to test latest changes or bug fix.
